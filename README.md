This is a web app I made using react following a react tutorial.
To run it locally:
  -clone this repository
  -cd into the directory
  -run npm install to install dependencies
  -then run npm start
  
Since this is the first app I've made with React there are a lot of comments
about how React works.  These were intended for my own note taking purposes, and
may not be especially clear, but hopefully they are useful to others too.
